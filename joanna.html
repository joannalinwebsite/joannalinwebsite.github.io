	<h1>Welcome to my CS4CS Blog!</h1>
	
	<h2> My Experience at CS4CS</h2>
	
	<p> When I first started my time here at CS4CS, I was so confused and I didn't understand anything.
	I was too scared and embarassed to ask for help because I thought I was the only person that didn't understand a single thing.
	But I soon realized that I wasn't the only one confused. 
	As time passed, I realized that in order for me to make my time here useful I had to start asking questions about what I was confused about so that I could learn.
	I realized that me not asking for help and not understanding the material wasn't beneficial to anyone and in fact, it probably did more harm than good.
	So I started to ask for help and soon, I started to slowly understand the material. 
	I still make mistakes but over time I'll get better hopefully.</p>
	
	<h2> My Learnings at CS4CS</h2>
		
	<p> I have learned so much about Computer Sceince and Cyber Security so far. 
	I've learned about different cyphers used to encrypt and decrypt messages and different commands used when coding on Python and Terminal.
	We learned how important it is to protect our devices from hackers and the different methods that hackers use to steal information.

	<h2>My Blog Entries</h2>
	
		<h3>July 19, 2018</h3>	
		
	<p1> Today, July 19th, we did an activity involving decrypting a message from Ariana Venti, who went missing during her performance at Coachella. 
	We had to used clues to find out what happened.
	Ariana left a ciphered message so we had to figure out the key and which method of ciphering should be used to decrypt the ciphered message.
	It took use a while, but we eventually figured out the key. 
	We then figured out that we had to use the Vigenere Cipher through process of elimination and soon after, we decrypted the message.

		<h3>July 24, 2018</h3>
	<p1> Today, we did part 2 of the Ariana Venti activity. We had to guess Ariana's password for her laptop.
	After we guess the password which was 'ariana626' we went on her laptop and had to look for clues as to what happened to Ariana.
	We decrypted some messages hidden in her files which led us to a photo. 
	After we found the photo, we used stepic and found a username called micki_ninaj8 and the name of a photo.
	We then went on instagram and found an account with that username. In that account, there was a photo with the same name we found using stepic.
	In that photo, she had five fingers covering her face. 
	Based  on that clue, we looked at every fifth word of all of Micki Ninaj's instagram.
	The message read "
