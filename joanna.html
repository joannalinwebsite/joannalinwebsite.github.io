	<h1>Welcome to my CS4CS Blog!</h1>
	
	<p> WELCOME TO MY PAGE ABOUT MY LEARNINGS AT CS4CS!!!</p>
	
	<p> When I first started my time here at CS4CS, I was so confused and I didn't understand anything.
	I was too scared and embarassed to ask for help because I thought I was the only person that didn't understand a single thing.
	But I soon realized that I wasn't the only one confused. 
	As time passed, I realized that in order for me to make my time here useful I had to start asking questions about what I was confused about so that I could learn.
	I realized that me not asking for help and not understanding the material wasn't beneficial to anyone and in fact, it probably did more harm than good.
	So I started to ask for help and soon, I started to slowly understand the material. 
	I still make mistakes but over time I'll get better hopefully.</p>
	
		
	<p> I have learned so much about Computer Sceince and Cyber Security so far. 
	I've learned about different cyphers used to encrypt and decrypt messages. 
	I've also learned about the different commands used when coding on Python and Terminal.</p>
