	<h1>Portfolio about Me</h1>

	<p> Hi there! My name is Joanna Lin and I am 14 years old. I was born on November 16, 2003 in New York. I live in the Bronx, New York. I will be a sophmore at Brooklyn Tech in the Fall. I like to play Baminton with my family during my free time. I also like playing the piano. I have been playing piano for 9 years so far. I also play the flute in my school's Intermediate band.</p>

My sister is going to be a senior at Bronx Science and my brother is going to the fourth grade at P.S.304. My siblings and I all play the piano. My sister also plays the clarinet in her school's Concert band.<p1>
